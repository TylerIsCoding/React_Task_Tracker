This Task Tracker application is built using React.js to manage tasks with names, dates, times, and optional reminders. The tasks are stored locally on the user's machine with localStorage so they won't be lost between sessions.

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Moment.js

## Project Overview
This project employs a combination of technologies to develop an engaging and responsive web application. Here's a breakdown of the tech stack and their respective roles:

- **HTML5**: Provides the foundational structure and content for the website. The application uses localStorage to store the tasks on the local machine so that tasks are stored between browser sessions.
- **CSS3**: Takes care of the visual styling and layout, ensuring an attractive design.
- **JavaScript**: Implements interactive features such as the navigation bar and form validation, enhancing user experience.
- **React**: The core of the application is built with function-based components, creating a real-time user experience on a single landing page. Users can add tasks by specifying a name, date, and time. Tasks are sorted chronologically and can be displayed with or without reminder tags.

By utilizing these technologies effectively, the React Task Tracker offers users a seamless and efficient way to manage their tasks.

## Lessons Learned</h2>
  - **Component-Based Development**: Developing with React.js reinforced the significance of a component-based architecture. This approach promotes code reusability, simplifies maintenance, and accelerates the development process.
  - **State Management**: Managing state effectively is crucial for React applications. Implementing state management libraries like Redux or using React's built-in useState hook can simplify complex data handling and enhance user interactions.
  - **Responsive Design**: Designing with responsiveness in mind is essential. It ensures the application looks and functions seamlessly across various devices and screen sizes, enhancing user satisfaction.
  - **Single Page Applications (SPAs)**: Building a single page application offers smoother navigation and better user experience. However, it requires careful management of routes and state to ensure consistent behavior.</p>
